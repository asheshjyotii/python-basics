1. Write a script that converts the following strings to lowercase: "An-
imals", "Badger", "Honey Bee", "Honeybadger". Print each lowercase
string on a separate line.
2. Repeat Exercise 1, but convert each string to uppercase instead of
lowercase.
3. Write a script that removes whitespace from the following strings:
string1 = " Filet Mignon"
string2 = "Brisket "
string3 = " Cheeseburger "
Print out the strings with the whitespace removed.
4. Write a script that prints out the result of .startswith("be") on each
of the following strings:
string1 = "Becomes"
string2 = "becomes"
string3 = "BEAR"
string4 = " bEautiful"
5. Using the same four strings from Exercise 4, write a script that
uses string methods to alter each string so that .startswith("be")
returns True for all of them
